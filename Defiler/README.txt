/************************
 * Implementation details
 *************************/

/* 
 * This section should contain the implementation details and a overview of the
 * results. You are required to provide a good README document along with the
 * implementation details. In particular, you can pseudocode to describe your
 * implementation details where necessary. However that does not mean to
 * copy/paste your Java code. Rather, provide clear and concise text/pseudocode
 * describing the primary algorithms (for e.g., scheduling choices you used)
 * and any special data structures in your implementation. We expect the design
 * and implementation details to be 3-4 pages. A plain textfile is encouraged.
 * However, a pdf is acceptable. No other forms are permitted.
 *
 * In case of lab is limited in some functionality, you should provide the
 * details to maximize your partial credit.
